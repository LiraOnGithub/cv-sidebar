# cv-sidebar
LaTeX-class for my CV

# How to use
You need some version of LaTeX to build your CV. I use XeLaTeX.

If you want to see an example of a full CV that uses cv-sidebar, take a look at https://github.com/LiraOnGithub/cv-sidebar/blob/master/cv.tex

This repo also contains the generated PDF: https://github.com/LiraOnGithub/cv-sidebar/blob/master/cv.pdf

# Compiling
You can compile your CV with `xelatex cv.tex`.
